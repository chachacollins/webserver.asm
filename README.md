This is a simple tcp server written  purely in assembly.
I wrote it as a meme but quickly found out that all the assembly hate and memes are misleading given how simple assembly is to write(ease is relative).
To run this ensure you have nasm and just run the build.sh script. You can then telnet localhost 6969 to see a beautiful message displayed on your screen
